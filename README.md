Welcome to whatbot
==================

This bot was written purely as an exercise in futility, to try, desperately, to replace the functionality of infobot without driving us insane. Part of that goal has been accomplished, and so we leave it out there for the world to use. Drop us a note if you decide to play with it. Maybe if we hit 1.0, we'll actually write a few docs. This is really just a project for fun, so there really isn't and hasn't been a rallying cry for more documentation and support infrastructure, so, uh, there isn't.

Playing with whatbot
--------------------

whatbot works. Grab it from github, copy over the example configuration, and edit it to do what you want. We will try to wrap up some documentation by the time we hit 1.0, but it may take some time.
